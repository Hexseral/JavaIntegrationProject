/* Jordan Tatum
 * This program is a demonstration of the course material we have covered so far within COP 2006.
 * I will be demonstrating the different Data Types within Java, but first we must understand what a Variable
 * is. A variable is essentially a container that holds values within a java program, and a variable can be 
 * declared to use one of the main eight data types offered in Java. The eight data types demonstrated in this 
 * program are Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, Char, String, and Boolean. Another important concept
 * is scope, and within Java scope refers to the visibility of a variable within a program. Scope is important
 * when building objects due to any variable defined within a class outside of any method can be used by 
 * all member methods. Scope and Variables are two important concepts to understand Object Oriented Programming.
 * See Below:
